    <h1>This is about me!</h1>
    <h2>My name is Adela Lara</h2>

    <p>
      I attend Santa Ana High School and I am a sophomore. I have two older sibling that live in San Jose. I joined the school's soccer team because I love the sport.
    My favorite food is tamales because it was part of something that I grew up eating every Christmas. I went to Lathrop Intermediate and joined the track and field 
    team, and when I raced aginst schools in the hurdlers I took first Place. Last year I joined design engineering and I joined the class because I learned how to draw
    shapes and how to make a 3-D model on a computer. When I was in seventh grade I got MVP for soccer, and in eighth grade I got MVP for basketball. I have always wanted
    to go to Japan because I want to know more about their culture.</p>
   <p>
     I'm not sure of what I want to be when I grow up. I can't decide between becoming a soccer player or becoming an engineer. I want to go to Santa Cruz for college but
     I also want to go to San Jose. My goal to finish college and have a great job and have a good life. If I become an engineer I want to pursue software or chemical engineer
     because I'm enjoying my chemical class and I want to learn more about computers. When I get older I want to travel all around the world and see how people live in their 
     country. I enjoy going to Mexico during the winter because it doesn't rain as often and I see the horses and ride them.
